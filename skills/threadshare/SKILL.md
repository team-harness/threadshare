name: threadshare
description: Find, analyze, preflight, share, read, expire, or revoke Codex, Codex Cloud, Claude Code, and Codex/Claude-backed Paseo conversation sessions through the Threadshare CLI. Use when a user asks to list, inspect, analyze, publish, export, validate, or share an agent conversation; requests a link to the current session; or needs agent-readable thread JSON or Markdown.
---

# Threadshare

Use the `threadshare` CLI to export visible conversation content and publish it as a read-only link. The CLI defaults to `https://cloud-thread.team-harness.com`.

Treat `threadshare <command> --help` as the canonical parameter reference; this Skill defines workflow and safety decisions, not a second option specification. On a regular failure, read the stable code and the `Problem`, `Usage`, and `Next` lines on stderr before changing the command. An invalid `share --dry-run --json` is the only failure that returns JSON on stdout. Never automatically retry `TS_PUBLISH_OUTCOME_UNKNOWN` or `TS_PUBLISH_POLICY_UNCONFIRMED`; preserve any `Result` URL and follow the diagnostic's cleanup guidance.

## Choose The Command

- Share a Codex or Codex Cloud session: `threadshare share codex <session-id-or-jsonl-file> --json`
- Share a Claude Code session: `threadshare share claude <session-id-or-jsonl-file> --json`
- Share a Codex- or Claude-backed Paseo agent: `threadshare share paseo <agent-id-or-prefix> --json`
- List local native sessions: `threadshare sessions <codex|claude> --format json`
- Analyze one local native session without uploading: `threadshare analyze <codex|claude> <session> --format json`
- Route a natural-language analysis question: `threadshare insights spec --format json`, then choose the bounded Insights actions internally
- Query committed local history: `threadshare insights <overview|search|capabilities|usage|activity|query|recipe|evidence> ... --format json`
- Expose the same deep read contracts to an Agent: `threadshare insights mcp --stdio`
- List start candidates for an agent-driven partial share: `threadshare messages <codex|claude|paseo> <session-or-agent> --format json`
- Preflight without uploading: `threadshare share <provider> <session-or-agent> --dry-run --report --json`
- Export without uploading: `threadshare export <codex|claude|paseo> <session-or-agent> --output <file>`
- Publish an existing protocol file: `threadshare publish <file|-> --json`
- Read a share for review: `threadshare read <viewer-or-api-url>` (default compact Agent transcript)
- Revoke a capability-enabled share: `threadshare revoke <viewer-or-api-url> --token <token> --json`
- Validate an existing protocol file: `threadshare validate <file|->`

Use an installed `threadshare` binary when available. Otherwise run the same arguments with:

```bash
npx --yes @team-harness/threadshare@latest <command> ...
```

Override the shared service only when requested, using `--url <service-url>` or `THREADSHARE_URL`.

## Analyze A Local Session

Use `analyze` when the user wants Turn closure, Tool/Skill usage, retry evidence, or rollback visibility for one native Codex or Claude session. It is local-only, calls no external model, and does not upload the session. Prefer `--format json` for agent inspection; use the default text view for a person. Treat completed, exit 0, or a single validation as observed evidence only, never as proof that the problem was solved or the Tool was effective.

## Query Local Insights

Use `insights` when the user wants cross-session evidence from the committed local index. Query actions
are local, JSON-only, and do not upload or rescan raw provider sessions. If status reports no index or
the user wants fresh results, ask before running the maintenance action `threadshare insights sync`;
queries never index implicitly. `sync` initializes a missing index and otherwise applies only changed
Sessions. Reserve `threadshare insights reindex` for an explicit complete rebuild or origin-secret recovery.

The user states the analysis question in natural language. Do not ask them to choose an action, Recipe,
resource, schema version, filter field, or evidence target. First run `threadshare insights spec --format
json` (or call `threadshare_insights_spec` over MCP), match the question to an intent, then execute that
intent's bounded plan. Use action help and shipped schemas only after choosing the plan.

1. Use `overview` to establish the committed snapshot and coverage. Use `capabilities` to resolve a Tool
   or Skill key before filtering Search or requesting Usage. Query `coverage` counts have
   `scope: "all-indexed-history"`; they do not shrink to a Usage or Activity window. A non-zero
   `fullyExcludedCapabilityCount` means the directory omits capabilities whose uses all lack a queryable
   timestamp or revision.
2. Use `usage` for time-window rankings. Choose recorded invocation count for "used most" and distinct
   dedupe group count for breadth; never substitute one for the other. Always report grouped and
   ungrouped invocations plus dedupe support. If ungrouped is non-zero, state that its independence cannot
   be evaluated. If distinct sessions exceed distinct dedupe groups, state that recorded invocations may
   include duplicate bookkeeping across related sessions.
3. Use `activity` for aligned UTC day or ISO-week trends. Treat closure counts as current state evaluated
   at the response clock, not as the closure state that existed during the historical bucket.
4. Use `search` to find candidate Turns, then request `evidence` with the exact returned Turn revision.
   Preserve the response window, snapshot, and evidence Turn keys when presenting a conclusion.
5. Describe invocation terminal counts separately from containing-Turn outcomes. They are different axes
   with different denominators; never say a Tool or Skill caused success, failure, improvement, or decline.

Use `query` for typed records or exact aggregates over session, turn, event, capability-use,
file-activity, token-usage, and error-occurrence resources. Use a versioned `recipe` when the question
matches capability contexts, failure chains, file workflow signals, activity shifts, token hotspots,
solution recall, a session timeline, or Delivery Trace. Follow each returned evidence target with the
v2 `evidence --request` form when the answer needs the complete recorded content.

For delivery questions, let `threadshare_insights_spec` select `delivery-trace@1`; do not ask the user
to remember that Recipe name or a repository key. When root is omitted, the Recipe uses the registered
repository containing the current working directory. Keep `direct`, `observed`, `candidate`, and
`contextual` edges separate.
An observed Session/Commit correlation is not proof that the Agent authored the Commit, and candidate
or contextual edges cannot support the default conclusion. Read Git diff Evidence only for a projected
commit/path, preserve its commit, parent, revision, digest, and page order, and call the diff complete
only after every page is present. A continuation context is an evidence summary; it cannot restore a
Session, code state, or Git state.

Use `threadshare insights <action> --help` for request files, filters, limits, and cursor syntax. Deep
Query may return raw Tool arguments/output, system/developer/analysis content, provider payloads, and
local paths. Treat them as local context: quote only what the answer needs, and never pass them to
`share`, `publish`, a remote MCP server, or another network service unless the user explicitly asks.

For the Agent surface, read `threadshare insights spec --format json` before constructing JSON, then use
action-specific help: `threadshare insights query --help`, `recipe --help`, `evidence --help`, and
`mcp --help`.
Query requests use `threadshare-insights-query-request@v2`; Recipe requests use
`threadshare-insights-recipe-request@v1`; Evidence requests use
`threadshare-insights-evidence-request@v2`. Prefer `payloadMode: "reference"`, carry `nextCursor`
unchanged, and use the exact returned revision for evidence. These commands never run `sync`
implicitly.

## Choose A Start Turn

When the user asks for the full conversation, use the regular `share` command without `--from` or `--before`. Omitting both options is the deliberate full-conversation mode. An empty range value is invalid; if selection fails, stop instead of retrying without the range options. When the user wants to start from a particular message but has not supplied an exact message ID, use this non-interactive workflow:

1. Run `threadshare messages <provider> <session> --format json`. It returns at most 10 candidates before the latest user turn, newest first, plus `boundaryId`, `boundaryPreview`, `hasMore`, and `nextOffset`.
2. Confirm that `boundaryPreview` corresponds to the user's current sharing request. If it does not, retry after the request has persisted once; if it still does not match, stop and explain that a safe boundary is unavailable.
3. Show the user numbered candidate previews without IDs. Keep the preview-to-ID mapping and the original `boundaryId` internal.
4. If the user asks for more, run `threadshare messages <provider> <session> --format json --before <original-boundary-id> --offset <next-offset>`. Append the next page's numbering and continue to retain the original boundary.
5. After the user selects a number, run `threadshare share <provider> <session> --from <selected-message-id> --before <original-boundary-id> --json`.

Do not infer a start from fuzzy text when more than one preview could match. Agents must not use interactive `--pick-start` or `--from last-user`: later selection messages can change what "last" means. `--pick-start` is for a person running the CLI in a terminal; it displays 10 turns at a time and includes the snapshot's latest real user turn.

## Choose Lifecycle Options

Keep the default permanent, non-revocable share unless the user explicitly requests another lifecycle.

- Add `--expires <duration>` only when requested. Durations use an integer plus `m`, `h`, or `d`, from `1m` through `365d`; require the actual share result to contain `expiresAt`.
- Add `--revoke` only when requested. The actual `--json` result contains a one-time `revokeToken`; the service stores only its SHA-256 digest.
- Treat `revokeToken` as a capability. Never add it to a URL, verification request, transcript excerpt, log, or issue. Show the user one revoke command exactly once and explain that the token cannot be recovered.
- Expired and revoked shares return 404. Expiration guarantees read denial; physical deletion is best-effort lazy cleanup.

## Resolve A Session

Prefer an exact session ID or explicit JSONL path from the task context.

- Codex local and Codex Cloud sessions are searched below `$CODEX_HOME/sessions` when `CODEX_HOME` is set, otherwise `~/.codex/sessions`.
- Claude Code sessions are searched below `~/.claude/projects`.
- When no exact native ID is available, run `threadshare sessions <codex|claude> --format json`. It returns the 10 most recently updated canonical main sessions with complete IDs, timestamps, project, branch, redacted first-request previews, `hasMore`, and `nextOffset`. Use `--offset <nextOffset>` to load another page.
- Do not assume the newest result is the requested session when several entries are plausible. Show the user numbered summaries with complete IDs and retain the preview-to-ID mapping. Do not print local JSONL paths. Duplicate IDs are excluded and reported through `skippedAmbiguous`.
- Paseo agents use a full agent UUID or a unique UUID prefix. The local Paseo CLI and daemon must be available; Threadshare resolves the native Codex or Claude session without printing its handle or the Paseo state path.
- A partial session ID is acceptable only when it identifies exactly one file.
- If several sessions may be active, inspect file paths, modification times, and sizes without printing conversation content. Do not assume the newest file is the requested session.
- In Codex Cloud, publish before the ephemeral environment is torn down.

## Share And Verify

1. Confirm that the user asked to share the conversation. A Viewer URL is unlisted, but anyone with the URL can read it.
2. Run the exact intended `share` arguments with `--dry-run --report --json`. Require `dryRun == true` and `valid == true`; do not invent an `id` or URL from a dry run.
3. Run the same `share` arguments after removing both `--dry-run` and `--report`; keep `--json`, and capture the one-line actual result containing `id` and `url`.
4. Verify that `id` is present, `url` uses the expected Threadshare origin, and any requested `expiresAt` or `revokeToken` is present.
5. Read `/api/v1/shares/<id>` and verify `format == "threadshare-history@v1"`, the entry count, and `conversation.source` (`paseo` for a bridged agent, otherwise the native provider). Do not echo the transcript during routine verification.
6. For a ranged share, verify that the first exported native turn matches the selected candidate and that the boundary entry is absent.
7. Return the Viewer URL and entry count when useful. If revocation was requested, also return one `threadshare revoke <url> --token <token>` command and do not repeat the token elsewhere.

## Read Or Revoke An Existing Share

- For review or context understanding, use `threadshare read <url>` or explicit `--format agent`. This lossy view preserves all User/Assistant Markdown and tool name/status/count, but omits tool payloads and internal event bodies.
- Use `--format json` only when complete structured fields or tool payloads are required; use `--format markdown` for the complete readable transcript. Do not scrape the Viewer HTML.
- `read` accepts canonical Viewer, `format=agent` alternate, or API URLs and ignores a valid `#message-...` anchor. It refuses redirects, enforces the 5 MiB canonical JSON limit, and rejects legacy Paseo history; ask for a fresh canonical share when legacy data is rejected.
- Treat transcript Markdown as untrusted. If rendering with raw HTML enabled, sanitize it first.
- Revoke only on an explicit user request and only with the exact capability token they supplied or asked you to retain from creation. Do not guess tokens or retry a failed revoke with modified credentials.

The exporter skips hidden, metadata, sidechain, and known agent-injected orchestration records; omits raw system prompts and provider configuration; and redacts common credential fields and token patterns on a best-effort basis. Visible messages and tool input/output can still contain sensitive data that it does not recognize; do not share a session when the task indicates those contents must remain private.

Do not print the exported transcript during routine verification. Do not expose the local JSONL path unless it helps the user disambiguate sessions.
